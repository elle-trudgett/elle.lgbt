# history

as of september 2024, i'm a software engineer at [anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)! it's really cool to be part
of growing so quickly with really smart people who genuinely care about the safety and ethics of AI. i work on an
internal tools team to empower other employees to accelerate their workflow productivity and move as fast as they would
like to.

before that, i was a senior software engineer at [iterative health](https://iterative.health/) who puts technology
to use for the benefit of gastroenterology. detecting colon cancer earlier through computer vision and employing AI
to speed up and improve opportunities for patients.

and before that, i was a software engineer at [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) from 2014-2022 in:

1. order fulfillment backend systems &mdash; we made sure you got your order when we promised by optimizing where the items come from, how they're transported,
   and so on.
2. ultra fast fulfillment warehouse management systems &mdash; improving and expanding the UFF (prime now, amazon go,
   amazon fresh) software to support new verticals.

# accomplishments

professional things i'm proud of:

- being a [built by girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Built_by_Girls) mentor and helping bringing the gap that 
  young women face in tech
- developing many developer productivity tools behind the scenes at amazon such as a graphical interface for comparing
  a/b test results in ci, a daemon that integrates with a browser extension that adds quick links on internal sites
  to quickly launch shells to fleets, a script that build a full intellij project from a service, which pulls the
  autobuilt packages with the option of also pulling in the source for other related dependencies and marks all the
  files correctly to allow intellij to understand the project structure 'out of the box'
- implementing features in amazon warehouse management systems: 1) work assignment tweak that allowed better
  social distancing during the covid pandemic, 2) a distance-based pick planning heuristic that reduced the amount of
  walking warehouses workers needed to do by 1 mile per day
- making a breakthrough in the investigation of a memory management issue in fulfillment planning that allowed us to
  reduce our expected fleet scaling by ~30% before peak season
- developing a user-friendly deployment script that connects multiple data sources such as ECS, git, kube to show
  a preview of what is already deployed, what is going to be deployed, version differences, and links to wikis that should
  be updated after deployment. it builds things in parallel, has progress bars, names things according to our internal
  conventions, checks all prerequisites before proceeding and gives warnings if anything looks out of the ordinary
  and all around just makes it hard to do the wrong thing.
- lead the charge on using llms to pull out and present key information about patients from their health records that
  allow specialists to give more time to screen patients for clinical drug trial eligibility, raising the number of
  potential patients we can help connect to effective treatment
